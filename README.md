# Crack_Detection_MASK-RCNN
Cracks in concrete structures create lots of problems especially in old buildings; timely identification and curing the cracks which has occurred on concrete can help in increasing the life time of the buildings. 
With the development happening in a rapid pace, there are lots of sky scrappers being built. It is not easy for a human to scan the surface of structures with naked eye and spot the cracks. This problem has to be solved so that the process takes less time to detect cracks in concrete structures.
Once the crack(s) are identified it will be easy to cure them which will increase the lifespan of the structure.
Here we have used MASK-RCNN to identify and mark the cracks down.
